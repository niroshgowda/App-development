  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visiting Rome in winter is a magical and memorable experience you won’t soon forget. The weather during winter in Rome will be a bit cold [Rome has an average temperature of 45°F in January and 47°F in Feburary], but that doesn’t mean you should write off visiting Rome in the winter altogether! Rome is one of the best places to visit in Italy and it is even more magical during the winter when prices are cheaper and the crowds are fewer.<br></br>
